  <h3>IntelliJ Flask Install</h3>

  <p>Using Python 3.11.1 and moved index.html to static folder to help maximize speed. This meant creating a custom install of Python. See bookmark.</p>
  <p>Looked into FastAPI which appears very promising. However, host doesn't support it, it's still too new, I already have sync functionality with js, the minimal scripting of notes means almost no benefit. Although, maybe improved speed with editing (it's already fast enough)?</p>
